# nanogenmo-2023

This was a quick and hacky entry for NaNoGenMo 2023: a process that takes hundreds of old newspaper stories and applies
the format of [the legendary 1979 "fremony at the library" misprint from the Peterborough Standard](https://bravenewmalden.com/2011/02/03/the-fremony-at-the-library/)
to them - erratically repeating the end fragment of the first sentence and eventually just switching to
a sports report. Other inspirations of the moment were B S Johnson and repetitious but superficially
plausible AI news content.

![Example output, the first paragraph of the book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevandotorg/nanogenmo-2023/main/screenshot.png?)

There are some mild OCR errors in there which aren't strictly in the spirit of the original, but they're not too far off.

I've only uploaded a truncated version of *news.txt* because it was a horrible 25mb scrape that the script was scanning
for usable story structures, skipping those which had the wrong format or too much OCR noise.
